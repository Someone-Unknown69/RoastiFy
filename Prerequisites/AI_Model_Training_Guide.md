# 🎵 AI Playlist Mood Classifier – Training Guide

> 🌟 Train your own AI model to classify the **mood of Spotify playlists** using features like **valence**, **energy**, and **tempo**.

---

## 🚀 What You’ll Learn

* 🧠 Understand how model training works
* 🤖 Train a mood classifier using real music data
* 💡 Export and integrate your model into a web or backend app

---

## 📃 Step-by-Step Learning Path

### 1. Python Basics 🐍

Learn the fundamentals of Python: syntax, loops, functions, and key libraries.

**Topics:**

* Variables, functions, control flow
* Libraries: `NumPy`, `Pandas`

### 2. Intro to Machine Learning 🤖

Grasp the ML concepts that power your classifier.

**Concepts:**

* Supervised learning: classification vs regression
* Features (`X`) and labels (`y`)
* Model training & evaluation

### 3. Training with scikit-learn 🛠️

Use scikit-learn to build and train a mood classifier.

**Key Concepts:**

* `model.fit(X, y)`
* `model.predict(X_test)`
* `train_test_split()`
* Accuracy, precision, confusion matrix

## 🧳 Understanding "Model Training"

> Think of it like teaching a kid:
>
> ✔️ Show 100 songs with features + correct moods
> ✔️ Kid learns the pattern
> ✔️ Kid starts guessing mood of new songs accurately

That’s model training in a nutshell.

## 🔥 Final Words

* Model training is not scary — keep it simple
* Start small using `scikit-learn`
* Integrate your model into your frontend or backend
* Build your own **vibe detector** ✨
